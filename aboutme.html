            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p></p>Hello there, my name is Andrew Situ. I am a current resident of the most culturally rich city, San Francisco. 
            I am Junior at Balboa High School.
            It was just last year that learned how to code through a class called ScriptEd-an extra-curricular that was offered at. This year I am taking an advance course called CodeNation. I seized the oppurtunity to apply for this class thinking that it would be fun to learn something new and that the future will hold many oppurtunities with the rapid spread of technology. 
            Especially in a city like San Francisco, many big tech companies like SalesForce and Atlassian have and will stay in this city, giving life to more jobs oppurtunities that require some knowledege of coding.
            My dream jobs is to become a nurse, I believe working in the medical field is the most amazing experience ever. I know that the future will have many technological advances, and most likely in the in to the medical field as well.
            With my knowledge with computers and coding, I would be able to do my work faster and more efficently. 
            </p>
